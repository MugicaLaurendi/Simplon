Question 1 : Please review the quality of the data, describe the data you are working on and present any issues
	- To do for artworks.csv

Question 2 : Draw a graph that would help us to understand more clearly the dataset

Question 3 : Let suppose you are a data scientist. You might consider cluster this dataset to get for example different clusters.
Which relevant transformations / data cleaning operations would you do before ?

Indications:
1. Are all the columns useful ?
2. What you are going to do on elements from artists table is called feature engineering:
	- get actual age or death age
	- is the artist alived : create a new column and sets 1 if it'is alived otherwise 0.
	- if possible, calculate the volumes of the artwork
	- Count number of elements inside 'Name_caller' and print the result inside a new column


3. On artworks table:
	- Acquisition date : transformed in another format
	- delete lines/columns ?
	- fill missing info ?


Bonus:
- Draw 2 easy other graphs that are useful to understand the dataset
- Is it possible to create a unify dataset, from the two files mentioned above ? If possible, do it and create a .csv file
- Clean artists.csv

NB:
You have to use the following methods:
.describe()
.unique()
.fillna()
.dropna()
.apply()
